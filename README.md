# Heterogeneous Causal Effects of Weather on Rail Public Transport Delays

This repository contains code and reproducible workflows for analyzing the causal effects of weather conditions on rail operations and public transport using causal machine learning methods.

## Scope
The project investigates how variations in weather (e.g., temperature and precipitation) affect delays, and performance across rail public transport networks.

## Methods
- Causal machine learning (PLR DML, Causal Forests DML)
- Weather data from the German Climate Data Center (DWD CDC)
- Rail and public transport operational data

## Reproducibility
Raw data are not included in the repository due to size and licensing constraints.
